# Translate Application With Speech Feature And Live Translation 

This particular application let's you translate any piece of text you want in provided languages.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool providing a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - State Management Library
- [Loadash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash) - A JavaScript utility library delivering consistency, modularity, performance, & extras. Also, for debouncing.
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - Http client.


### What I learned

This project helped me further analyze zustand as a state management library and I had a overall great experience getting to use it hands on and learning it's intricasies. Furthermore, the concept of debouncing the API call is something that was quite unique to also get familiar with especially both concepts of throttling and debouncing. Major use of component based programming was something I kept in check this time as well.

### Continued development

I still would keep like to dive deep into vitest for testing my zustand store and along with that further build complex applications leveraging great animations and complex visual logics.
